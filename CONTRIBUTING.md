# Contributing to Awesome Pydantic AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome Pydantic AI! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this curated list.

## Guidelines

### What qualifies as awesome?

Only add projects that are truly awesome. A project is considered awesome if it:

- Is directly related to Pydantic AI or significantly enhances Pydantic AI workflows
- Has a clear purpose and solves a real problem
- Is actively maintained (recent commits within the last 6 months)
- Has proper documentation (README with clear instructions)
- Works as advertised
- Has a permissive license (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, CC, etc.)

### Quality over quantity

We value quality over quantity. Please don't add projects just to increase the list size. Each addition should provide genuine value to the Pydantic AI community.

## How to Contribute

### Adding a new resource

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a new branch** for your addition
3. **Add your link** in the appropriate section of README.md
4. **Follow the format**: `- [Project Name](URL) - Brief description ending with a period.`
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you're adding and why it's awesome

### Link format

All entries should follow this format:

```markdown
- [Project Name](https://github.com/user/project) - Brief description that explains what the project does and why it's useful.
```

**Format rules:**
- Use the official project name
- Description should be concise (one sentence)
- Description should start with a capital letter
- Description should end with a period
- No trailing whitespace

### Categories

Please add your link to the appropriate existing category:

- **Official Resources** - Official Pydantic AI documentation and repositories
- **Frameworks & Libraries** - Extensions and libraries built on top of Pydantic AI

If your resource doesn't fit any existing category, suggest a new one in your PR description.

### Pull Request requirements

Your PR should:

- Add only **one** link per PR (makes reviewing easier)

- Ensure the link is working and points to the correct resource
- Check that the resource is not already in the list
- Verify the project has a license

## Updating existing links

If a project has moved, been renamed, or you want to improve a description:

1. Fork and create a branch
2. Make the update
3. Submit a PR explaining the change

## Removing links

Links may be removed if:

- The project is no longer maintained (no activity for 12+ months)
- The link is broken
- The project no longer relates to Pydantic AI
- The project violates its license or community guidelines

To suggest a removal, open an issue explaining why.

## Code of Conduct
